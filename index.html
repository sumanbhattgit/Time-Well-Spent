<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<h3>There are more than 185,000 charities in the UK,
    hundreds of which are in London.</h3>
<p>We want to connect people with spare time and who feel isolated <br> from working
    at home with their local community through volunteering. <br> There are dozens of
    types of charities with roles for every type of person. <br> You can use this website to
    find out about your closest charities and how <br> to get involved.
    It's a challenging time for everyone at the moment due to <br> Coronavirus. It is more
    important than ever to support and help out local community.</p>

<h2>Enjoyable</h2>
<p>
    We all wish that the
people in our community
didn't need our help.
Being a part of your local
network through
volunteering can help
you make substantial,
meaningful changes,
leading to the need for
charities diminishing,
whilst promoting a
healthy community spirit
in our urban spaces!
